## Purpose / Use cases
This tool is intended for legitimate testing, privacy and troubleshooting in authorized lab or development environments.

## Purpose / Use cases
This script is intended for legitimate, authorized uses only. Typical use cases include:
- Privacy testing and MAC randomization in controlled environments.
- Network troubleshooting and device replacement testing.
- Lab exercises and QA for networked systems (VMs / test networks).
- Emulation of device identities for development and debugging purposes.

## Purpose / Use cases
This utility exists to support responsible network testing, debugging and privacy workflows in controlled environments. It is useful for:
- Performing privacy experiments and MAC randomization during Wi‑Fi or device testing in an isolated lab.
- Troubleshooting network issues where MAC identity affects device behavior (e.g., DHCP/static mapping, switch port security).
- Simulating replacement devices or managing virtual NICs in development and QA contexts.
- Educational lab exercises that teach networking fundamentals and the effects of link‑layer identity changes.

**Important:** Use only in environments where you have explicit authorization. Do not use this tool to bypass network security controls or on networks you do not own.
